## Software testing fundamentals ⚙️
Before you can start testing software, you need to understand the terminology, the logic reason of when to do what and the why.
i suggest of corse to learn ISTQB FOUNDATION as a ground base of knowladge required to start your path from.
there is also a need to understand testing methologies such as Agile and SCRUM framework which is the main domain of performing test nowdays.
here are main objectives a QA tester need to understand and apply, the more deeper the understanding will go, the smarter the QA tester will be, the more proffesional skills and confidence he will add to the project under test.

The QA tester has main responsebility, to give confidence in the stability of the software to performe as the client expect it be.
we need to thibk on every scenario, every test case, we need to challenge the software in the most creative possible way our time and budgest allow in order to alert on every defect we can find to raise the confidence rate before the software goes production.

## Testing Types 🎯
- [Top Page](#The-Software-Testing-Router)

Theres many testing types and techniques, each one is suited for a different need in the SDLC, most of them can be automated(will be discussed later in this repo) and some are are avalable only when using third-party tools and scripting language.

Here are testing types and techniques a tester must understand and apply when scenario require:

Testing Levels:
* `Unit testing`
* `Component testing`
* `Integration testing`
* `System testing`
* `Acceptance testing`

Testing techniques and tactics:
* `smoke test`
* `sainaty test`
* `Black box testing`
* `White box testing`
* `End to end testing` - AKA E2E testing,
* `Load testing`
* `Regression testing`
* `API testing`
* `UI testing`
* `Alpha testing`
* `Beta testing`
* `Production testing`

# Testing Tools 🛠️
* [`Leonardo`](https://github.com/outbrain/Leonardo) - Developed By outbrain dev team, This tool allow you as a dev or tester to test your app behaviour under empty inputs, errors coming from the server and situations when the server not responding, Also, unique option is to check "Slow" server responds behaviour.


# Test Management and Collaboration Tools 🤝 🧠

  * [`Jira`](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) - This well known tools.. 
  
  * [`YouTrack`](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) - Developed by Jet Brains, some of you know this company as the developers of Intellij, but this tool
  
  * [`testlink`](https://testlink.org/) - Well known open source test management tool
  
  * [`Testrail`](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/) - currently marked as the top tool (*paid) for team collaboration in the agile era
